We proposed a methodology for quantifying the risk of misperceptions between what the ego car beliefs to be true about its environment, and ground truth. Exploiting this in industrial practice requires learning quality guarantees for sensor components, the use of different training and test sets for all relevant ODD, and monitoring that the learning components are only active in ODD for which they were optimized. This demands the capability of HAV to  switch between different versions of learning components. A practical solution for this could be to use techniques similarly to caches, downloading learning components from the cloud when switching to rarely encountered ODD.
